# Myco-Interfaces
Thesis Statement 

Throughout the canon of human-computer interaction, the two agents have always been the machine and the human. Recently, weâ€™ve witnessed speculative interfaces emerge that incorporate organisms such as plants and other species to imagine new types of organic interfaces. One organism, mycelium, has not undergone much exploration in this area. In this project, I am looking to address the following question: how might we use mycelium to facilitate new insights in physical interaction design?
